# AWSScripting

This is a collection of AWS Python scripts to perform various functions.

*AWSListInstancesBasic* is a very basic instance list utility with Python3 and boto3.

*AWSListInstancesBasic2* is an expanded basic instance list utility with Python3 and boto3.

Both require boto3 and the AWS CLI installed and that your AWS logon has been defaulted in the CLI install.


*awstools-master* is just something I downloaded from github as an example that has a lot of instance/resource creation code in it.
